## Some assumptions: 
1. I have taken in my game that the barbarian does not move diagonally. 
2. All the distances are Manhattan. 
3. Cannon always attacks the closest troop.
4. Infinite number of rage spells, heal spells, barbarians can be called (can be changed with a single line of code) - like playing the hacked version of the game. 

## Instructions:
1. 'r' triggers rage spell
2. 'h' triggers heal spell
3. '1' = spawn at 1st spawn pt
4. '2' = spawn at 2nd spawn pt
5. '3' = spawn at spawn 3rd pt
6. 'q' = quit
7. 'p' = pause game for 1 second. 

8. `python main.py` to run the game. 
9. `python replay.py` to replay the game. You will be asked to input the n_th previous game to replay. 1 is the most recent game.
