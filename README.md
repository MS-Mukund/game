## Some assumptions: 
1. I have taken in my game that the barbarian does not move diagonally. 
2. All the distances are Manhattan. 
3. Cannon always attacks the closest troop.
4. Infinite number of rage spells, heal spells, barbarians can be called (can be changed with a single line of code) - like playing the hacked version of the game. 

## Instructions:
1.  'r' triggers rage spell
2.  'h' triggers heal spell
3.  '1' = spawn barbarian at 1st spawn pt
4.  '2' = spawn barbarian at 2nd spawn pt
5.  '3' = spawn barbarian at 3rd spawn pt
6.  '4' = spawn archer at 1st spawn pt
7.  '5' = spawn archer at 2nd spawn pt
8.  '6' = spawn archer at 3rd spawn pt
9.  '7' = spawn balloon at 1st spawn pt 
10. '8' = spawn balloon at 2nd spawn pt
11. '9' = spawn balloon at 3rd spawn pt
12. 'q' = quit
13. 'p' = pause game for 1 second. 

14. `python main.py` to run the game. 
15. `python replay.py` to replay the game. You will be asked to input the n_th previous game to replay. 1 is the most recent game.
